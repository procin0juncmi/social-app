The book is divided into five parts: Studying Genomes, Genome Anatomies, How Genomes Function, How Genomes Replicate and Evolve, and Appendix. Each part contains several chapters that explain the concepts, methods, and applications of molecular genetics with clear illustrations, examples, and exercises. The book also includes a glossary, an index, and a CD-ROM that contains additional resources and interactive tutorials.
 
Genomes 3 is an ideal textbook for undergraduate students who are studying molecular genetics or related disciplines. It is also a useful reference for researchers and professionals who want to learn more about the structure, function, and evolution of genomes. The book is available in both print and digital formats.

Genomes 3 is praised by many readers and reviewers for its clear and comprehensive coverage of molecular genetics. The book is written in an engaging and accessible style that makes it easy to follow and understand. The book also provides a historical and conceptual context for the topics, showing how the field has developed and why it is important. The book is suitable for both beginners and advanced students who want to learn more about the fascinating world of genomes.
 
One of the strengths of Genomes 3 is its emphasis on genomes as the central theme of molecular genetics. The book shows how genomes are studied, mapped, sequenced, annotated, and compared across different organisms and domains of life. The book also explains how genomes function and regulate gene expression, how genomes replicate and repair themselves, how genomes recombine and mutate, and how genomes evolve over time. The book illustrates these concepts with examples from various model organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, plants, animals, and humans.
 
Another strength of Genomes 3 is its inclusion of exercises and tests at the end of each chapter. These exercises and tests help readers to check their understanding and apply their knowledge to real-world problems. The exercises include multiple choice questions, short answer questions, figure tests, data analysis questions, and research questions. The tests are designed to assess readers' comprehension, synthesis, analysis, and evaluation skills. The book also comes with a CD-ROM that contains additional resources and interactive tutorials that enhance the learning experience.
